git-new-workdir.bat
===================

A windows port of [git-new-workdir](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir).


## Install

Download [git-new-workdir.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murank/git-new-workdir.bat/master/git-new-workdir.bat) and put it into the directory in PATH (e.g. C:\Program Files\Git\cmd).


## Usage

``git-new-workdir <repository> <new_workdir> [<branch>]``


## Why not use [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree)

The feature is so new that some git clients (including ones I'm using :D) don't support it.
